1. CMOS Digital Logic Circuits
===================================================================
	CMOS is the most dominant circuitry today (almost all IC)
		- Noise Immune
		- Built with Low Power
		- High level of Integration

	Analog circuitry will still always exist
		- Everything is analog in nature
		- Making Analog signals into Digital
			-- PreAmplifier: (op amp) Analog Circuit, amplifies analog signal
			-- Digitize Signal: Analog Circuit, Analog to Digital Converter

	13.1 Digital Logic Inverters
		- The most basic element in digital circuit design
		- Same role as the Amplifier in analog circuits
		- 13.1.1 Function of the Inverter
			-- Convert 0 to 1, 1 to 0
		- 13.1.2 Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)
			-- Noise Margins (Regions immune to Noise)
				1. V_iL: The maximum value Vi can have to be logic 0
				2. V_iH: The minimum value Vi can have to be logic 1
				**REMEMBER:
					-- Four parameters: (V_OH, V_OL, V_IH, V_IL)
					-- How to determine Noise Margins from transfer characteristic curve
					-- Inverter is good at rejecting noise
		- Ratio'd Logic dissipates DC power
			-- Consumes too much power
			-- Death of Bi polar machines
			-- Not as good noise margins
			-- DC/Static Dissipation
		- CMOS as Inverter
			-- Intrinsic low power technology
			-- Only has Dynamic Power Dissipation (to first order)
				** Consumes power only when charging and discharging
			-- Based off how the MOS transistors interact.
				** Complementary Pull-Up Switch (PU) - when Vi is low, PU is closed (PMOS)
				** Complementary Pull-Down Switch (PD) - When Vi is low, PD is open (NMOS)
			-- CMOS is king

		- Can be built in different ways other than CMOS
			-- Ratio'd Inverter (one NMOS transistor)
				** [Figure in Notes]
			-- CMOS Inverter (PMOS and NMOS with gates tied to Vin)
				** [Figure in Notes]
			-- ECL (Emitter Coupled Logic): 
				** Bipolar Junction Technology. 
				** High Power, but 
				** High Speed
				** [Figure in Notes]


2. Power Dissipation
===================================================================
	Overview:
		- CMOS is LOW POWER Technology
			-- This is what makes it the dominant technology
		- Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI)
			-- Describes methods to design and implement [Very Compact] integrated chips.
				** More than [1 Million] per chip
		- Static Power Dissipation
			-- Power lost when switch is open/ closed (not moving)
		- Dynamic Power Dissipation
			-- Power lost when switch is opening/ closing (moving)
		
	Equations:
		- Power dissipation is calculated by:
			-- Pdynamic = C(Vdd)^2f
				** Derived by adding the Energy Dissipated during both the charge and discharge of the capacitor.
				** Charging: 1/2 the energy drawn is dissipated through Rp, and 1/2 is stored to the capacitor.
				** Discharging: the Stored Energy on the capacitor (the other half of original energy drawn) is dissipated through Rn.

		- To minimize dynamic power dissipation:
			-- Capacitance should be minimal
				** Shortens the length of transients
			-- Vdd should be minimal
				** This is why modern devices use 5V supplies, as opposed to 12 or 15V
			-- Although Frequency Can be reduced, we want to increase the speed in digital technology

	Lecture Notes:
		- Where does the Load Capacitance come from?
			1. Gate Capacitance of subsequent stages (Cascading Inputs)
				-- Or, The capacitance needed at Vo to drive other circuits.
				-- Implied/Instrinsic.
				-- Add all the Capacitances in Parallel.
			2. Wire Capacitance
				-- Minimize
			3. Parasitic Capacitance at drains
				-- Minimize

3. The CMOS Inverter
===================================================================
	Lecture Notes:
		- The NMOS and PMOS will Never be both On at the same time
			-- No DC path from Vdd to Ground  
			-- Only power dissipated is the transient power when charging/ discharging
				** Dynamic Power
		- Review [Figure 13.18 & 13.19]:
			-- Operations of the CMOS inverter (current vs Vo).
		- Review [Figure 13.20]: 
			-- Voltage-Transfer Characteristic of a CMOS when Qn and Qp are matched
			-- Regions of the transfer curve are used to determine operating regions of transistors and set up equations
				** Useful when the transistor parameters are not equal (Kp' != Kn', etc.)
		- Review [Equations on Pg 4]: 
			-- NMOS and PMOS in an Inverter.
			-- Linear and Saturation Current of devices as functions of Vi.
		- Review [Figure 13.6]
			-- Digital IC Technologies and Logic-Circuit Families.
		

		- Why is CMOS King?
			-- CMOS dissipate [less power]
			-- MOS transistors offer [higher input impedance]
			-- The size of MOS transistors has been reduced drastically in recent past, more so than bipolar technologies.

4. Propagation Delay
===================================================================
	Lecture Notes:
		- Propagation Delays:
			-- The Time difference between a change in input and reaction at output.
			-- Should be obtained by inspection, including the waveforms.
			-- More specifically, the 50% point to the 50% point (50% of input to 50% of output)
			-- [Figure 13.13] is a visual of ideal definition
			-- [Figure 13.15] is a visual of practical definition
		- Time Propagation (tPHL and tPLH)
			-- Propagation time from high-low and low-high
		- Rise Time/ Fall Time
			-- 10% - 90%, and vice versa

		- [Figure 13.23] Equivalent circuits for determining the propagation delays
			-- Break down the CMOS operation to two parts, tPHL and tPLH
			-- Use knowledge of single time constant circuits to:
				** determine the time propagation and 
				** construct the Vo and current waveforms.
			-- Rn and Rp are not linear in real circuits!!
				** But, they are good approximations
			-- How do we find Rn and Rp?
				** For a Specific technology
					1. Measure Vo(t) for an inverter in lab
						-- Fit curve to [Vo = Vdd*e^(-t/RnC)]
						-- Pick Rn and remeasure for best fit
						-- Rn scales for other NMOS sizes!!
							** Rn prop= (L/W)
					2. Simulate inverter w/ SPICE
						-- Fit Rn to the Vo curve after applying Vi
					3. Analytical Estimate
						-- Rn and Rp are proportionate to these variables
						-- tP prop= (Cl*Vdd)/Iaverage
							-> Isat = (1/2)u*Cox*(W/L)(Vdd-Vt)^2
							-> Ilin = uCox(W/L)(Vdd-Vt)(Vdd/2)-...
						-- Very roughly: I prop= u*Cox(W/L)Vdd^2
						-- tP prop = Cl/(u*Cox(W/L)Vdd)
			-- How do we Minimize Propagation Delay
				1. Decrease capacitance to drive
				2. Increase the mobility and oxide Capacitance
				3. Increase the Width and decrease the Length
				4. Larger Vdd
			-- When does sizing matter
				** Scaling the input to larger gates to drive a large load capacitance
				** "Scaling Theory"

		- Summary:
			-- Equations 13.64 through (13.68) in textbook yield several observations:
				** Using [Larger (W/L) ratios] can result in lower tP
				** A [larger supply voltage Vdd] results in lower tP
			-- These observations demonstrate the ["trade-offs"] associated with design of digital logic gates.


5. CMOS Logic-Gate Circuits
===================================================================
	Overview:
		- Using digital CMOS to build other digital logic gates besides inverters
		- Mostly all integrated circuits sold are digital CMOS
			-- 85% - 90%
			-- Bulk of Signal Processing
		- Analog CMOS are mainly "niche technologies"
			-- Def: Products designed for a small part of the technology market
			-- Will never go away, the world is Analog in Nature.

	Lecture Notes:
		- CMOS Logic Gate is extension of Inverter
			-- NMOS [pull-down] transistor/ network
			-- PMOS [pull-up] transistor/ network
			-- The Logic is defined by a single network path
				** Both paths are never on at the Same time
				** = Low Power
		- These two networks are operated by input variables in a [complementary fashion]
			-- Networks are complementary
			-- Solve one network, and implement the other network by using the complementary or parallel logic
				** Switch inputs that are in:
					Parallel -> Series
					Series -> Parallel
		- The CMOS Logic Gates work readily up to 4 inputs
			-- More than 4, begins to slow down
		- To design an arbitrary Gate
			-- Create Truth Table
			-- Create Karnaugh Map
			-- Determine the Equation for one network
			-- Complement network to create the other network
